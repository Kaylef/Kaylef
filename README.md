- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kaylef and I'm studying to become analyst-programmer.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics of the most used languages in software development.
- 🌱 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly collaborative projects with my fellow students in my program, but any small projects to perfect my knowledge would be good.
- 📫 You can reach me by email soon.
